# Milestone 2
1. with Br and Bi equal to zero, there is no gain or loss on the propagated wave
2. When Bi gets changed to 8, with a simple Gaussian there is a steady gain in the forward propagation and a steady gain once it gets reflected 
2. When Bi gets changed to 8, with a modulated Gaussian 
3. When Br is 80 with no Bi then the wave is now detuned, this is represented by the wave be out of phase, and consisting both real and imaginary components.
3. It has both real and imaginary components becuase of the exponential term being added to the electric field
4. By adding Br and Bi components, it is both detuned and has gain/loss. This occurs because of the real and imaginary components being added to the Electric field
